# notes for updates

*referring to image*

just make this plain text? And get rid of the the "are"

like remove the bullet points?
Yeah and the circle

I think if the sentences are just slightly spaced

Idk i got some feedback that the circle and bullet point format was a bit tricky to

oh yeah just go no line i guess
do you think u could try the scrolly shit as well?
